# Mozzi Osc Plateform
### Eurorack ready Developement plateform for the arduino librairy Mozzi  


### Concept

Inpsired by Hagiwo's projects around arduino nano boards and Mozzi Librairy, I created this rather simple oscillator oriented developpement plateform.
This allow to connect quickly four knob, one 1V/oct input, and one Audio out (eurorack level) to your arduino nano board. This way, you can develop your dream oscillator (or any kind of sound module you want) super easily!!
